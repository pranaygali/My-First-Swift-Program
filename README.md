**What is Xcode?**

Xcode is an _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE) for developing apps in the Apple ecosystem. We&#39;ll be focusing on iOS apps, but you can also make apps for macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. IDEs (like Xcode) contain and integrate many powerful tools that make software development easier for programmers.
